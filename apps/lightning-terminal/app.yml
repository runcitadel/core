  tagline: The easiest way to manage channel liquidity
  description: >-
    Lightning Terminal is the easiest way to manage inbound and outbound
    liquidity on the Lightning Network. Keep your channels open and the funds
    flowing. It provides a visual interface for interacting with your channels
    and balances using Loop. 


    New: Introducing Lightning Pool, a marketplace for Lightning channels. You can now earn sats by opening new channels to those looking to receive funds on Lightning for a set period of time, or rent a channel to start accepting payments instantly. Join the marketplace and start putting your Bitcoin to work.


    Why use Pool?

    - Earn a return on Lightning capital

    - Rent a channel and start accepting payments instantly

    - Open channels for less with transaction batching


    Why use Loop?

    - Add "inbound liquidity" to receive payments

    - Reduce transaction fees by recycling and reusing Lightning channels

    - Send funds to and from users or services that aren't yet Lightning enabled

    - Configurable wait times and "batching" allow for further fee savings

    - Refill and offload funds from any number of Lightning channels in a single on-chain transaction
