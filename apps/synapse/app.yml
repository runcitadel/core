  tagline: Matrix reference homeserver
  description: >-
    Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix from
    the core development team at matrix.org, written in Python/Twisted. It is intended
    to showcase the concept of Matrix and let folks see the spec in the context of
    a codebase and let you run your own homeserver and generally help bootstrap the
    ecosystem.


    The easiest way to try out your new Synapse installation is by connecting to it
    from a web client.


    An easy way to get started is to install the "Element" app on your Umbrel and
    change its Homeserver URL from matrix.org server to your Synapse's Homeserver
    URL of http://umbrel.local:8008 (or http://<synapse-tor-hidden-service-url> if
    you are accessing remotely).


    In Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through to
    a Matrix homeserver. The homeserver stores all their personal chat history and
    user account information - much as a mail client connects through to an IMAP/SMTP
    server. Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver and control
    and own your own communications and history or use one hosted by someone else
    (e.g. matrix.org) - there is no single point of control or mandatory service provider
    in Matrix, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.
