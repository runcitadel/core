  description: "Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first,\
    \ powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Home Assistant\
    \ integrates with over a thousand different devices and services. Once you have\
    \ integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash Home Assistant\u2019s advanced\
    \ automation engine to make your home work for you. Examples: \n\n- Turn on the\
    \ light when the sun sets or when coming home \n- Alert you when you leave your\
    \ garage door open \n\nAll your smart home data stays local. Home Assistant communicates\
    \ with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud\
    \ if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything\
    \ is processed locally."
